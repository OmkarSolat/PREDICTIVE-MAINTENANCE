# PREDICTIVE-MAINTENANCE
A data science project that predicts equipment failures using sensor data to enable proactive maintenance and reduce unplanned downtime.

- 📊 Project Overview
This project uses machine learning to analyze historical sensor data and predict the likelihood of machinery failure. The goal is to reduce unexpected downtime and optimize maintenance schedules.

-❗ Problem Statement
Unexpected equipment failures can cause costly production halts. Traditional reactive or scheduled maintenance may not be sufficient. The aim is to predict failures in advance to prevent unplanned outages

- 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze machine sensor data
- Identify patterns linked to equipment failure
- Build a predictive model for maintenance needs
- Help reduce maintenance costs and improve uptime

- 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost / Random Forest / Logistic Regression
- Jupyter Notebook

- 📁 Data Description
- Sensor readings from equipment over time
- Target column indicating failure or not
- Features may include temperature, pressure, vibration, etc.

- ⚙️ Approach
- 1.Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- 2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- 3.Feature Engineering
- 4.Model Building (multiple ML models)
- 5.Performance Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, AUC)
- 6.Model Comparison & Selection

- 🧾 Conclusion
The model helps industries implement predictive maintenance by accurately forecasting equipment failures, saving time and operational costs.
